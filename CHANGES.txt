zc.recipe.cmmi changes
======================

unreleased
==========

Features added
--------------

Added an 'extra_options' buildout option to pass extra configure
options to the configure step. This is useful when compiling a library
that expects another library to be installed in another part already,
such as libxslt which expects libxml2.
