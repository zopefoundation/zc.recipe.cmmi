Various tests
=============

This doctest contains misc tests.

Creating the location folder
----------------------------

When the recipe is subclassed, the `location` folder might be created
before `zc.recipe.cmmi` has a chance to create it, so we need to make
sure it checks that the folder does not exists before it is created.
   
In the test below, the `foo` folder is created before the recipe
is launched::

    >>> location = join(sample_buildout, 'parts', 'foo')
    >>> mkdir(location)

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... log-level = DEBUG
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... """ % (distros))

    >>> print system('bin/buildout') 
    Installing...
    ...
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>
    
    >>> ls(join(sample_buildout, 'parts'))
    d  foo
